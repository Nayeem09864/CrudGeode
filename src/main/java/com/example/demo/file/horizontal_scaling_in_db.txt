Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, refers to the process of adding more machines or nodes to a
distributed system or network to handle increasing loads. In the context of databases, horizontal scaling involves
adding more servers to a database cluster to distribute the load and improve performance.

Here are some key points about horizontal scaling in databases:

    Addition of Nodes: Instead of increasing the capacity of a single server (vertical scaling), horizontal scaling
    involves adding more servers to a system. Each new server is a node that contributes to the overall processing
    power, storage, and memory of the system.

    Load Distribution: In a horizontally scaled database, the load is distributed across multiple nodes. Each node is
    responsible for a subset of the data or transactions, which helps prevent a single point of failure and allows the
    system to handle more concurrent requests.

    Improved Performance: Horizontal scaling provides a way to handle increased demand by adding more nodes to the
    system. This can improve performance and responsiveness, especially in scenarios where the workload is distributed
    unevenly.

    Elasticity: Horizontal scaling allows for elasticity, meaning that resources can be added or removed dynamically
    based on demand. This makes it easier to adapt to changing workloads without significant downtime.

    High Availability: By distributing data across multiple nodes, horizontal scaling improves fault tolerance and
    availability. If one node fails, the others can continue to operate, reducing the risk of service disruptions.

    Cost-Effectiveness: Horizontal scaling can be a more cost-effective solution than vertical scaling because commodity
    hardware can be used. It also allows organizations to start small and scale as needed, rather than making a large
    initial investment in a single powerful server.

    Challenges: While horizontal scaling offers many advantages, it also presents challenges. Data distribution and
    consistency across nodes, as well as the complexity of managing a distributed system, are aspects that need careful
    consideration.

Popular databases that support horizontal scaling include NoSQL databases like Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, and Couchbase.
Additionally, some traditional relational databases, like MySQL and PostgreSQL, also offer features or configurations
that support horizontal scaling.
