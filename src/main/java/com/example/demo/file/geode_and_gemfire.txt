Apache Geode and Apache GemFire are essentially the same distributed in-memory data grid (IMDG) system but with
different names due to historical reasons.

Here's a bit of history:
    GemFire: GemFire was originally developed by GemStone Systems, Inc. It's a distributed data management platform that
    provides real-time, consistent access to data-intensive applications throughout widely distributed cloud
    architectures.

    Acquisition by VMware: VMware acquired GemStone Systems in 2010 and continued the development of GemFire.

    Open Sourcing as Apache Geode: In 2015, VMware open-sourced GemFire under the Apache Software Foundation. It became
    known as Apache Geode. The decision to open source the project was aimed at fostering a larger community and
    accelerating development through collaborative efforts.

    Parallel Development: After the open-source release, both Apache Geode and VMware GemFire continued to evolve
    somewhat independently, but their core functionality and API compatibility remained intact.

    Apache Geode as the Active Project: Over time, the Apache Geode project gained more traction and became the primary
    focus for new features and enhancements. VMware GemFire remains available, but Apache Geode is the more actively
    developed open-source version.

In summary, Apache Geode and Apache GemFire refer to the same distributed in-memory data grid technology, with Apache
Geode being the open-source version and GemFire being the earlier proprietary version. If you're starting a new project
or evaluating these technologies, it's generally recommended to use Apache Geode.
