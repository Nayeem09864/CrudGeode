gfsh (pronounced "jee-fish") stands for Geode shell. It's a command-line interface provided by Apache Geode for
interacting with and managing Geode clusters. gfsh provides a set of commands that allow users to perform various
administrative tasks, monitor the system, and interact with the data stored in Geode.

Here are some common use cases for gfsh:

    Cluster Management: You can use gfsh to start and stop Geode members, manage regions, and configure the properties
    of the Geode cluster.

    Data Management: gfsh provides commands to interact with data in Geode regions. You can put, get, and query data
    using gfsh commands.

    Monitoring and Troubleshooting: gfsh allows you to monitor the health and performance of your Geode cluster.
    You can check member status, view logs, and gather statistics.

    Scripting: You can script gfsh commands, which is useful for automating various tasks and integrating Geode
    management into your deployment or CI/CD processes.

Here are a few examples of gfsh commands:

    start locator
    start server
    create region
    put
    get
    query
    list members
    describe region
    show metrics

Using gfsh is often a convenient way to perform administrative tasks, especially in scenarios where a graphical user
interface is not available or practical. It's a powerful tool for managing and interacting with Apache Geode clusters.
