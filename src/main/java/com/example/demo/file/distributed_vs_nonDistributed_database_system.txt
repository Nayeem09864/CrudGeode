The primary difference between distributed and non-distributed databases lies in
how they manage and store data across multiple nodes or locations. Here's a
breakdown of the key distinctions:
Distributed Database:

    Data Distribution:
        Definition: A distributed database is a database that spans multiple
        locations or nodes, and the data is distributed across these nodes.
        Data Storage: Data is divided and stored on different machines or servers.
        Examples: Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, Google Cloud Spanner.

    Scalability:
        Horizontal Scalability: Distributed databases are designed to scale
        horizontally, adding more nodes to the network to handle increased load.

    Performance:
        Parallel Processing: Distributed databases can perform parallel processing,
        as each node can operate independently, leading to improved performance.

    Fault Tolerance:
        Redundancy: Distributed databases often incorporate redundancy and
        replication to ensure fault tolerance. If one node fails, data is still
        available from other nodes.

    Consistency Models:
        Consistency Challenges: Achieving strong consistency in a distributed
        environment can be challenging due to the need for coordination between nodes.

    Data Latency:
        Network Latency: As data is distributed, network latency can impact the
        speed of data retrieval and updates.

Non-Distributed Database (Centralized Database):

    Data Location:
        Single Location: A non-distributed or centralized database stores all its
        data in a single location or server.

    Scalability:
        Vertical Scalability: Scaling a non-distributed database typically involves
        increasing the capacity of the existing server (vertical scaling).

    Performance:
        Limited Parallel Processing: Performance improvements are limited to the
        capabilities of a single server, as parallel processing is restricted.

    Fault Tolerance:
        Single Point of Failure: A centralized database is more vulnerable to a
        single point of failure. If the server goes down, the entire system becomes
        unavailable.

    Consistency Models:
        Easier Consistency: Achieving strong consistency is often easier in a
        centralized database, as there's a single point of control.

    Data Latency:
        Lower Latency: Since all data is stored in one location, data retrieval
        and updates typically have lower latency compared to distributed databases.

Use Cases:

    Distributed Databases:
        Suitable for applications that require high scalability, fault tolerance,
        and the ability to handle large amounts of data across multiple locations.
        Commonly used in cloud-based and global applications.

    Non-Distributed Databases:
        Appropriate for smaller applications with lower scalability demands where
        data can be effectively managed within a single server.
        Often used in traditional, on-premises setups.

In summary, the choice between distributed and non-distributed databases depends
on factors such as scalability requirements, fault tolerance, and the geographic
distribution of users and data. Each approach has its advantages and challenges
based on the specific needs of the application.
